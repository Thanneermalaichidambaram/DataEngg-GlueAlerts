# DataEngg-GlueAlerts
**Glue Alerts** is a Python script for monitoring AWS Glue jobs that exceed 2 DPUs. It categorizes jobs as Running, Idle, or Failed, and sends color-coded Slack notifications with job details like status, DPUs, and last run time. The script supports AWS SSO, provides insights for optimizing Glue workloads, and handles errors gracefully.
